Sébastien: Hi, Sébastien here.

Frédéric: and Frédéric !

Sébastien: Today, we will visualize with you guys a sample from the Human Microbiome Project.

Frédéric: What's this microbiome project ?

Sébastien: Basically, it's an effort to study the bacteria that we
host on and in our human bodies.

Frédéric: Can you describe this sample a little bit ?

Sébastien: Sure. The sample is SRS011134 (see link in the comments). Researchers from the 
Human Microbiome Project extracted DNA from a human male's stool. This DNA is presumably mostly
from bacterial source. And now we have a bunch of files containing DNA data for that on
a computer.

Frédéric: But... How large is the data ?

Sébastien: About 13 Gigabytes and it's compressed too.

Now I'll show you how we can visualize this data.

Sébastien clicks the link

Sébastien: so first, we have to select the sample. After that, we select a section (there's just one here),
and finally, we select a place where we want to start and we go there.

The blue moving squares located in the top of the display tells us that
it is loading.

The circles are DNA sequences found in the sample and the links represent
genetic overlap of all but one letter (these letters are called nucleotides).


The life bars on top of each small circle represents its abundancy.

Frédéric: So,  what can I do with that ?

Sébastien: Well, you can explore huge DNA graphs using a web browser. That's cool, is it not ?

Sébastien: For example, I can select a part of this graph to inspect its DNA sequence.

Sébastien: I can also zoom in and out and move around.

Frédéric: What else can you do with that toy ?

Sébastien: Well, the main entertaining feature is to press thet play button and let
the thing transport you in places you have never been before. Let's start !

Sébastien presses the play button.

Sébastien: Hi, Sébastien here.

Frédéric: And Frédéric ! Today, we will show how to visualize a sample from the Human Microbiome Project with Ray
Cloud Browser. So, just to put us in context, what's this microbiome project ?

Sébastien: Basically, it's an effort to study the bacteria that we
host on and in our human bodies. Some of these bacteria are very hard to grow in a laboratory.
So the trick is to read bacterial DNA without growing them first using DNA sequencing.

Frédéric: Can you describe this sample a little bit ?

Sébastien: Sure. The sample is SRS011134 (see link in the comments). Researchers from the 
Human Microbiome Project extracted DNA from a human male's stool. This DNA is presumably mostly
from bacterial source. And now we have a bunch of files containing DNA data for that on
a computer.

Frédéric: And how large is the data ?

Sébastien: About 13 Gigabytes and it's compressed too.

Now I'll show you how we can visualize this data.

Sébastien clicks the link

Sébastien: so first, we have to select the sample. After that, we select a section (there's just one here),
and finally, we select a place where we want to start and we go there.

The blue moving squares located in the top of the display tells us that
it is loading.

Sébastien: Now that's loaded, Frédéric will explain what we see.

Frédéric: The circles with a letter inside (A, T, C, or G) represent DNA sequences found in the sample and the links 
between them are genetic overlap of all but one letter (these letters are called nucleotides).

Frédéric: Hovering over a circle shows us its true sequence in the bottom left.
Also, the life bar on top of each small circle represents its abundancy.

Frédéric: So, Sébastien what can I do with that viewer ?

Sébastien: Well, you can explore huge DNA graphs using a web browser. That's cool, is it not ?

Sébastien: For example, I can select a part of this graph to inspect its DNA sequence.

Sébastien selects DNA sequences

Sébastien: I can also zoom in and out and move around using the controls in the top-right corner.

Frédéric: What else can you do with that toy ?

Sébastien: Well, the main entertaining feature is to press the play button and let
the thing transport you in places you have never been before. Let's start !

Sébastien presses the play button.

Sébastien explains what we see (to complete)

Frédéric: That's nice, but where's the science ?

Sébastien: with this, we inspect the structural relationships between DNA sequences found in a given
sample. For example, here we can see one repeated region unwind into numerous strings that use it.
